# Statistical Analysis of Computer Sales using Python

## Overview
This project applies **statistical analysis techniques** to refine **computer sales strategies** using Python. It explores **customer purchase probabilities, price trends, and marketing budget impact** to improve sales performance.

## Key Insights
- **16% probability** of purchasing a computer with **8GB RAM, 14-inch screen, and processor > 33MHz**.
- **90% of total sales come from premium computers**, and **50% of premium computers include a CD player**.
- **Average computer price:** **$2,219.58**  
- **Sampling Analysis:**  
  - **Simple Random Sampling Average Price:** **$2,466.87**  
  - **Stratified Sampling Average Price:** **$2,203.93**  
- **Marketing Budget Analysis:**  
  - Increased from **$221.3B in 2022 to $222.2B in 2023**.
  - **Hypothesis testing confirmed a significant budget increase.**  

## Techniques Used
